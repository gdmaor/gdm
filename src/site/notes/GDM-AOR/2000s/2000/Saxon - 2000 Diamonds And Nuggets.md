## The Songs
This is an assortment of various demos and unreleased material. It comes courtesy from the Graham Oliver and Steve Dawson 'Saxon' side of the fence. Both men were embroiled in a bitter court battle with Biff Byford's real Saxon over the rights to the name.

This 78 minute collection encompasses nineteen tracks, spanning nearly thirty years. There are early tracks from **Coast**, Dawson and Quinn's early 70s band prior to Saxon. Plus there are three shelved 'Power And The Glory' outtakes from 1983.

It can be repetitive. There are wo versions of 'Freeway Mad (part 2)' and 'Frozen Rainbow'. Overall though, this is a fine glimpse into Saxon's forgotten moments.

## The Songs
A trio of live favourites open the CD. 'Stallions Of The Highway', 'Midnight Rider' and 'Frozen Rainbow'. The liner notes stating Nigel Glockler is on drums, so these must be culled from a 1983 gig. Nothing exceptional. Two of the 'Power And The Glory' edits follow, 'Turn Out The Lights' and 'Coming To The Rescue'.

The third effort 'Make 'Em Rock' appears near the end, but all three are the main reason to own this CD. Representing Saxon at their peak, it displays their penchant for melody and crunch. 

'Turn Out The Lights' can almost be pegged as AOR Metal, with a favourable hook and thrilling guitar fills. The lyrics, concerning a retired circus highwire walker devastated at the closing of the circus, are brilliant off-beat Byford lyrics.

'Coming To The Rescue' and 'Make 'Em Rock' are full tilt metal, and of better quality than much of the actual 1983 album. Particularly 'Watching The Skies' and 'Midas Touch'. These could have made a classic album that much better.

Hardcore Saxon fans (I'm part time these days) will find much to savour with raw demos of 'Wheels Of Steel' cuts. Like 'See The Light Shining', Stand Up And Be Counted', 'Street Fighting Man' and both 'Freeway Mad (part 2)' versions. Inevitably they are a pale shadow of the final copy.

'Ann Marie' is a song recorded by Saxon in their 'Son Of A Bitch' days. It contains a riff used later for 1981's 'Midnight Rider'. This was written before Biff showed up, according to Oliver.

'Lift Up Your Eyes' is a **Coast** composition with Byford on vocals, while 'Walking' is **Coast**'s first recording. It's from way back in 1972, typical and basic early 70's **Savoy Brown** type hard rock.

Then there's  'Still Fit To Rock 'N' Roll (later removing the r 'n' r and adding' boogie'). Plus 'Frozen Rainbow' and 'Big Teaser', all three represent the debut albums crude origins. The album is completed by two rare tracks. The memorable, unreleased, 'Ain't You Glad To Be Alive' and 'Stone Room Jam' (later to become 'The Eagle Has Landed').

## In Summary
There's a lot to digest with this one, although for many Saxon fans the demos are already well known. I can't emphasise how superior the lost 1983 session tracks are. Quality musicianship, perfectly produced and most of all metal of the highest order.

The booklet enclosed with the CD is first rate, with detailed liner notes from veteran scribe Dave Ling and a track by track analysis from Oliver and Dawson. While these men may be wrong to insist they are the real Saxon, hats off for making this music available. Even it is a cash in.

Oliver states that 'there are many more gems to be unearthed should the demand exist'. That's nice, but next time how about more unreleased bonuses please?
