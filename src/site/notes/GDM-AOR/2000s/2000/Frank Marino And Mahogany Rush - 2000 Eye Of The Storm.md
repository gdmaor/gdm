## The Songs
It's a known fact, I am a huge Frank Marino fan, whether solo or with his band Mahogany Rush. Have been for years. Despite the erratic material and lengthy musical workouts, Marino was a huge drawcard on the Arena circuit during the 70's. A fact not lost on concert promoters and his record label CBS.

Taking the term 'power trio' to new level, Frank and Mahogany Rush were one of the loudest bands on the tour. Their brand of hellfire blues fuelled hard rock mixing with space/epic like themes proved popular for many.

A spate of good albums such as 'Whats Next', 'Juggernaut' and 'The Power Of Rock'N Roll' keep his name in lights. By the late 80's and 90's, Marino had drifted off the scene, got married and started a family. In his words, he became a father late in life. Even though the odd release cropped up from time to time. His 2000 effort 'Eye Of The Storm' is one such release.

## The Songs
The material here is nothing like the barnstorming stuff from the Mahogany Rush glory days. Frank's sound fuses jazz, psychedelic, fusion, blues and progressive angles. Tone wise, his guitar has **Eric Johnson**, **Pat Thrall**, **Joe Satriani**, **Carlos Santana** and other modern day axeslingers in it.

There's no overkill on the phaser or wah-wah. Instead, there are some interesting and different approaches which indicate that there is more to the Marino bag of tricks than what we've been accustomed to. After the three minute introduction, we come across the title track 'Eye Of The Storm'. It's complete with tribal drums, distorted vocal intro, and a middle eastern vibe. The solo section is intense and atmospheric, without the need for tearing up the fretboard.

Even the emotion soaked vibe that is 'He's Calling' features some of his best guitar moves in years. And the track is a good ten minutes long too. Check out the solo, wow. Another lengthy workout is 'Heat Of The Moment', which undulates through soft and hard moments. It borders on a trippy 60's vibe at times, and the usual blazing solos are restrained mostly. I really liked 'Window To The World', a modern sounding arrangement, like **Eric Johnson** on steroids.

Then we get the excellent Southern rock flavoured 'Since You Came Into My Life'. Really, think the best bits of Skynyrd, Hatchet and the Allmans.. and you'll hear it all rolled into this one tune. Marino then gives us a fusion blast with 'Avalon', which carries over into the ten minute finale 'Ordinary Man'. Here we navigate through various musical charted waters that have influenced Marino over the years.

## In Summary
This is a comeback album for Marino And Mahogany Rush. Some things remain the same. Namely the guitar power, where it sounds like his guitar is powered through a series of overblown pre-amps. Plus there's the lengthy compositions.

What has changed are the different styles that have been applied. Die hard Marino fans will be pleased, other younger pups who have no idea who he is should investigate this along with the entire Mahogany Rush back catalogue.
