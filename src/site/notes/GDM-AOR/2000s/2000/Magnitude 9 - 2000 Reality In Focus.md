## Background
Magnitude 9 were a talented prog metal band with band membership located in Ohio and also Colorado who were active during the late 90's and early 2000's.

The band members themselves were all highly proficient and technical musicians. Their three albums between 1998 and 2004 are a living testament to that fact. This article refers to their second album 'Reality In Focus'.

## The Songs
As mentioned, this lot were highly technical and compare similarly to **Dream Theater** and **Fates Warning** during this same timeframe. The guitar and keyboard work is a highlight, while the underpinning rhythm section is exceptional.

For me, the album highpoint is the 9 minute epic 'Afterlife'. When technical American prog metal is ever discussed, this song should be at the forefront of the conversation. Truly outstanding stuff.

Not far behind is the 6 minute bombast of 'Temples Of Gold', everyone has bought their A-Game to this track. In fact, it's the longer tracks which seem to hold the attention more than most, 'Mind Over Fear' at 7 minutes completing the trifecta.

I'd also go so far as to say that singer Corey Brown sounds uncannily like **Bruce Dickinson** on 'Flight Of Icarus'. I guess that comparison is warranted considering this is a cover of a **Iron Maiden** song.

Opener 'No Turning Back' is also a song entitled to repeat play, this one more in keeping with 80's melodic metal. Pretty damn impressive if you ask me.

## In Summary
Magnitude 9 were a band we should have written about back in our Heart Of The Rock days. There really wasn't any excuse because I was listening to them that far back.

Magnitude 9 released one more album, 2004's 'Decode The Soul' which I've been advised is not as OTT as this album (yes I haven't heard that one), but I'm still going to check it out.
