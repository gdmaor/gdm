## Background
'Anorak - What's wrong with that?' ask Marillion, a band who claimed, with tongue in cheek, they're 'uncool as fuck'. Given this evidence, you'd be forgiven for thinking that the Los Marillos have given up completely on the idea of being contemporary. The fact is, nothing could be further from the truth.

'Radiation' had, in part, shown the band in a more aggressive light and it's more laid back moments earned comparisons with **Radiohead**. And 'marilliondotcom' had elements of commercial friendliness ('Rich' and 'Deserve') and trip-hop ('House').

'Anoraknophobia' takes further steps to experiment and to  shake the 'prog' tag with which they are still somewhat unfairly labelled.

## The Songs
The album opens with the seemingly pop-flavoured 'Between You And Me' with its jangly guitars and quirky drum loop. It amazes me how Marillion are still regarded as prog by the rock press and largely ignored by everyone else. Dinosaur rock it most definitely is not. The great hit single which never was? Absolutely. The track has a great breezy, summery quality which deserves to reach a much larger audience.

'Map Of The World' is also rooted firmly in the pop/rock field. It's a borderline AOR tune. Though nowhere near as AOR as some parts of 1991's 'Holidays In Eden. That album was co-written with ex-**Cutting Crew** man Nick Van Eede.

On the darker side, 'Quartz' re-visits the trip-hop feel of 'House'. Although it's far more aggressive with Pete's circular bassline giving the song a solid backbone. Like the previous track', 'Quartz' also deals with the subject of a busted relationship. Lyrically it finds Hogarth in a rather bitter mindset.

Using timepiece symbolism to portray the people within the song _'I'm clockwork and you're Quartz'_ is the work of genius. It takes a subject which has been written about like a million times before to a whole new level.

This idea is especially effective when Hogarth (and I'm assuming the song is about him, as many of his previous lyrics have been based on personal experience). There's no question about it, 'Quartz' is one of the best songs the band have ever written. Period. 'When I Meet God' is lighter and features a fairly gentle, though heartfelt vocal and a well rounded musical arrangement.

'This Is The 21st Century' also centres itself around a lightweight musical arrangement. Although it's the polar opposite of 'Quartz' its also a strong contender for one of the greatest songs Marillion have ever recorded.

Once again,, it's my guess that had this song been written by a more 'popular' band, it would've been lavished with praise. The way the press treat Marillion most of the time, though, I can't see any songwriting awards on the horizon.

'Separated Out' once again provides great contrast, it's driving force being Steve Rothery's aggressive and driving guitar riff.  It's a sort of distant relation of 'Hard As Love' from 1994's 'Brave' album, this track should appeal to those of you who enjoy melodic rock with a harder edge.

## In Summary
Eight songs. No fillers. A playing time of just over an hour. Quality. I can't tell you any more plainly than that. It's one of the best albums of 2001 and it's certainly Marillion's strongest album since 1994's 'Brave'. Anorak - what's wrong with that? Absolutely nothing.
