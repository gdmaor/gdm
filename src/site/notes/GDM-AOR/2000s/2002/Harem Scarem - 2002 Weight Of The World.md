## Background
You could call this a return to form. Long debates have occurred in the past about the direction of Canadian melodic rock band Harem Scarem and it's subsequent offshoot **Rubber**. Many a melodic rock bulletin board or email discussion thread has ensured HS top billing as a topic.

Not a band to sit still, nor conform to the demands of fans or the media, the Harem Scarem boys have ploughed their own path, their discography being a testament to that fact - with each one being different than the predecessor. The mainstays Hess and Lesperance still lead the band, while the Harem Scarem Class of 2002 is an intoxicating brew of debut era HS, melded with the modern pop/rock tones of **Rubber**. Very appropriate in todays musical climate.

## The Songs
It takes nearly a minute to rip into the title track after the acoustic intro, but it's worth the wait as the churning guitars (a la **Paul Gilbert** / **Mr Big**) and big chorus provide the entree to 'Killing Me', perhaps a single given it's modern appeal. 'Outside Your Window' has that 'sway factor' on the chorus, you can just imagine participating along with them during a live show - bodies swaying from side to side. Again the **Mr Big** comparison kicks in on 'All I Want' - a fired up anthem for 2002.

A track which should have the teen audience tuning in over the summer is 'You Ruined Everything', another modern rocker with attitude. 'Charmed Life' has an interesting arrangement, and it works a charm treat. 'If You' has all the catchiness from the debut, though Pete's guitar has obviously been run through the same amp setup as **Butch Walker**. A pure melodic rocker a la **Tyketto** is 'See Saw' despite it being an instrumental. They end the album in uptempo fashion with the aggressive rumble of 'Voice Inside'. Wow.

## In Summary
I can say this CD's gonna get a heap of playing time over the next wee while. My only fear is that the band will 'move on' yet again into new uncharted territory, frustrating fans with their variable approach to their output. In the meantime, you'll be doing well to find an album as entertaining in the melodic rock genre this year. Be thankful that Harem Scarem have found a pitstop in 2002 and offloaded a gem.
