<h2><font color=red>Iron Maiden Background**</h2>
Iron Maiden are another band from the great 80's back with famed vocalist Bruce Dickinson and a third guitarist Janick Gers.

Not that you would know, soundings very much like the old Iron Maiden. And obviously they weren't quite brave enough to do too much in the way of the new. This is an album squarely aimed at existing fans rather than attracting new ones.

## The Songs
In the music department Iron Maiden have definitely developed from the simple tracks of the past, the three guitars offer plenty of scope and don't disappoint. 

There are catchy riffs, time changes and acoustic interludes. Production is also very good and a touch of keyboards add the bit of depth that was probably needed a few albums back. Keyboards on a Iron Maiden album? Who would have thought it, what next?

## In Summary
Keeping what I always termed the 'medieval' touch, its a classic Maiden-sounding album, some good and some great music.

Sadly there are lots of good tracks but no really great ones. In places the tracks are a tad similar and in other places a bit too long and repetitive. 

Iron Maiden makes it into the new millennium but only just. Maybe not offering quite enough. But still what they do offer is quality heavy metal complete with a worthy pedigree from the 80's.
