## Background
I am a happy chap to say the least. The welcome return of Shooting Star, one of my favourite bands. A studio album, the first for a very long time, since 1991's 'It's Not Over' in fact. Goodness, a lot of water has flowed under their bridge since then. **Nirvana** have come and gone, so have **Oasis**. But these guys keep it coming.

The basis of the lineup is still intact, with Christian Howes filling the violin slot left vacant by Charles Waltz years ago. Thankfully, the sound is as rich and compelling as it was back when Gary West was fronting them. Though Keith Mitchell's singing style is more harder rockin', the band don't lose anything in comparison. It's good hearing songs like these again, like a long lost friend.

These twelve efforts are a mix, with four of them being co-writes between Van McLain and Gary West. So these must go back some way, while most of the others are McLain efforts. Production was handled by Kevin Beamish, who must have felt like he was in a timewarp putting this album together.

## The Songs
Van's grunty guitar gets us underway with the very high octane 'I Just Wanna Rock', a great concert anthem for sure. The violins make a reappearance on 'If You Want It' and complement the stabbing piano lines from Dennis Laffoon.

The title track 'Leap Of Faith' is a laid back new country flavoured ballad, which could very well find it's way to AC format radio. So too 'Call It Love', though I'd say it's not a true representation of the overall album, which severely rocks.

'She Drives Me Crazy' and 'Find A Way' are big sounding rockers with fat choruses and searing guitar breaks. 'Face To Face' is a return to **Kansas** like progressive elements. It has time changes galore and keyboard playing **Steve Walsh** would be happy with.

Some other nice efforts include the AOR induced 'Higher Power', 'Love Is A Shield' and 'Promises'. The album has a definite 80's feel, but it's base is in the here and now with the modern production.

## In Summary
The qualities which made them stand out from the rest of the pack are still evident to this day. More importantly, these are shown on this album. Van's guitar is still great as always, while Rod Lincoln's drumming remains a cornerstone of their sound.

'Leap Of Faith' sits between the 'It's Not Over' album crossed with their mid 80's stuff. In particular 'Three Wishes' and 'Burning'. Fans of quality melodic rock/AOR should seek this out immediately. A great return for one of AOR's most important bands in the year 2000. Welcome back Shooting Star.
