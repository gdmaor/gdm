## Background
The Scandinavians have always had a reputation for taking their melodic rock seriously, spawning hundreds of AOR bands. They've always had a great love of prog also, but not many of their home-grown talents have gained recognition overseas.

Recently, that's started to change with the soaring popularity of Sweden's **Flower Kings**. Also hailing from Sweden are Xinema, whose brand of crossover AOR/prog should (I hope) be appealing to many of you out there.

## The Songs
A three-piece band that were previously known as **Madrigal**, Xinema have both the songs and musical chops to make it. 'In The Scent Of The Night' is the best **Saga** tune in many a moon, the lead guitar part comes straight from the Ian Crichton school of playing.

Sven Larsson is a guitar hero in the making and between his very flash (but never overplayed) guitar work and Mikael Askemur's **Tony Banks** inspired keyboard parts, this album has many classy moments.

'One Day' is smooth and very chorus driven and harkens back to the one album by MTM signings **Storming Heaven** with its **Asia** meets **Gowan** qualities. The title track features a good performance from vocalist Mikael, who - it must be said - has an excellent voice.

It's a slightly slower piece showing **Genesis** influences, which definitely would not have sounded out of place on the criminally under-rated 'Calling All Stations' album.

The technical edges of 'Maybe Time' and 'Blind Is The Light' are very 80s in a **World Trade** and **Baxter Robertson** vein, though it has to be stressed, its in no way similar in the vocal department - Mikael seems more than happy singing without the aid of a helium balloon.

## In Summary
In all honesty I can tell you there are no aspects of this album I dislike. All three band members are great musicians (there's something magical about three-piece bands) and the songs are strong with memorable choruses. In short, if you have a liking for any of the bands mentioned here, this is essential listening.
