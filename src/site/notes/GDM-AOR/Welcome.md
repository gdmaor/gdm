# GloryDazeAOR website

### About Us
This is the start page for the GloryDazeAOR website, now hosted on the **Netlify** publishing platform, using **Obsidian** as our documentation base, and **GitHub** as our online storage repository. This site is the fourth iteration of the GlorydazeMusic brand, first starting out in 2006.

We prefer to look back and review the music of older records which occupy the timeline from the mid 60's up to the current day. We specialise in pop, clsssic rock, melodic rock and AOR, west coast, progressive pop, art rock, symphonic rock, heavy metal and progressive metal.

Our reviews are readable from our online library, accessible from the Left Sidebar on both desktop and mobile eco-systems.

We are gradually importing old content into the system, along with new reviews as we go.

Happy reading.

George (aka Gdazegod)
